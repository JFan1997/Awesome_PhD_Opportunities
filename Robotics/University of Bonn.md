## About the Humanoid Robots Lab
The Humanoid Robots Lab has been participating in various national and international projects funded by the German Research Foundation and the European Commission and has contributed cutting-edge research, combining AI and robotics for personalized robot service, cultural heritage, and sustainable agriculture. The lab concentrates on robots acting in human environments and has developed novel techniques that allow robots to adapt their behavior to the environment and to the surrounding people, thereby exploiting semantic information about objects and information about the activities of users. The lab has introduced several novel methods for environment modeling as well as for planning navigation and manipulation actions for wheeled and biped robots. Among them are techniques for 3D environment perception and explorati
