## PhD Position at University of Sannio

The [University of Sannio](https://www.linkedin.com/school/universit%C3%A0-degli-studi-del-sannio-benevento/), Department of Engineering, Benevento, Italy, is offering a three-year PhD position in the “Automatic Control” curriculum focused on methods and techniques of computer vision applied to mobile robotics.

### Research Activities
The PhD candidate will undertake a project focusing on an autonomous mobile robotic system, specifically a quadruped robot equipped with a six-degrees-of-freedom robotic arm and gripper. The research will develop innovative methods and techniques for target object detection using onboard cameras. Additionally, the candidate will design algorithms to dynamically plan and execute robotic arm missions for manipulating the target object, which may include picking, carrying, placing, or precise positioning tasks.

This research opportunity is funded by [Mosaico Monitoraggio Integrato s.r.l.](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mosaico-iot/) through the #PNRR DM 630 national program and will be scientifically supervised by Prof. Carmen Del Vecchio. Research activities will be conducted at both the GRACE Lab at the University of Sannio, Benevento, Italy, and the Mosaico Monitoraggio Integrato lab in Morra de Sanctis, Avellino, Italy.

### Candidate Profile
We are seeking highly motivated students with a Master’s degree in Automation, Control Engineering, Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, or related fields. Candidates expecting to graduate by October 2024 are also welcome to apply. The ideal candidate should exhibit a strong passion for research, proficiency in modeling and control, advanced programming skills, and the ability to work both independently and within a team.

### Application Process
Interested applicants should send their CV, cover letter, and references to [c.delvecchio@unisannio.it](mailto:c.delvecchio@unisannio.it). Please feel free to contact Prof. Del Vecchio for further information before applying. Applications should be sent by July 25th. Interviews will be held at the end of August and beginning of September.
