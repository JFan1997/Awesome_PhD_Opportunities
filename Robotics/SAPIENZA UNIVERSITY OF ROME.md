# PhD Opportunity at SAPIENZA UNIVERSITY OF ROME

Have you just graduated with a Master's in Robotics, Automation, Artificial Intelligence, Control Engineering, or a similar field? Or do you expect to do so by October 21, 2024?

Here is a chance to pursue a PhD degree at Sapienza University of Rome that allows you to advance the state of the art in robotics research while addressing a relevant industrial problem with a leading company in the aerospace field.

A three-year PhD position is available on “SAFE HUMAN-ROBOT COLLABORATION FOR MANIPULATION” in the DRIM (Robotics and Intelligent Machines) national doctorate program.

The theme of this project concerns the introduction of collaborative robotic systems in a prototype cell for the semi-automatic assembly and testing of aerospace components and devices.

## Research Topics
- Collision/contact detection and safe robot reaction
- Task-preserving reaction strategies in the presence of kinematic redundancy
- Optimal placement of vision/depth sensors for cell monitoring
- Sensorless estimation of contact forces
- Human motion/intention prediction
- Force, impedance, admittance control for generic contact locations along the robot
- Learning schemes for repetitive collaborative tasks under largely uncertain dynamics

The research activity is co-sponsored by [Thales Alenia Space Italy (TASI)](https://www.thalesaleniaspace.com/en) and supervised scientifically by Alessandro De Luca ([deluca@diag.uniroma1.it](mailto:deluca@diag.uniroma1.it)).

Our research group has a long experience in physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI) — see the [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvAUmIzqq6oaRtwX9l9sjDhcNMXNCGSN0).

Activities will be performed both at the [DIAG Robotics Laboratory](https://www.youtube.com/user/RoboticsLabSapienza) and at the TASI Laboratories in Rome.
