Dear colleagues,

The University of Southern Denmark (SDU) is seeking a PhD candidate on safe energy-aware robotic teleoperation.

The overall objective of the 3-year PhD project is to use energy-aware approaches to build a safe and robust teleoperation system which takes into account time-varying human and environment dynamics and variable large time delays. In particular, the use of formal energy-based modeling and control methods will allow to provide safety guarantees on learned behaviors. This position is in collaboration with the Robotics and Mechatronics group of the University of Twente (UT), The Netherlands. This PhD project will be conducted primarily at SDU, with close collaboration between the two universities. The PhD candidate will be able to make regular visits to UT to ensure the expertise of both labs is well integrated.

### Research contents:

- Employing methods from the energy-aware robotics framework, including passivity theory and port-based modeling, to develop energy-aware methods that guarantee robust stability of the teleoperation system under varying environments and in the presence of large time delays.
- Building on recent developments in energy-aware control approaches, including control barrier functions, to create a safety layer capable of enforcing safety constraints. These include the energy content of the teleoperation system, applied forces, and energy flow between the system, human operator, and environment.
- Developing (reinforcement) learning based methods, producing policies that can assist the human operator in actively varying the remote robot’s impedance in real-time, while maintaining to satisfy the robust stability and safety constraints through the energy-based safety layer.

### Essential requirements:

- Excellent MSc in robotics, electrical engineering, or relevant degree.
- Solid understanding of robot kinematics, dynamics, control, and modeling.
- Good software development and programming skills in C++, Python, ROS tools, and related robotics libraries.
- Strong scientific problem-solving attitude and critical thinking capacity.
- High self-motivation to learn, and ability to work independently and collaboratively in a team in a highly international environment.
- Good communication, reading, and writing skills in English.

### How to apply:

Please send CV, transcripts at bachelor and master levels, referee names or reference letters, and a Cover Letter (a description of your study and/or research experience and a research plan) to Dr. Cheng Fang (supervisor at SDU, [chfa@mmmi.sdu.dk](mailto:chfa@mmmi.sdu.dk)) and/or Dr. Wesley Roozing (co-supervisor at UT, [w.roozing@utwente.nl](mailto:w.roozing@utwente.nl)). The deadline for the application is July 31, 2024.

### The universities and labs:

University of Southern Denmark (SDU) is the birthplace of robotics research in Denmark. It has a world-class research environment and infrastructure featured by its leading position in the collaborative robotics area. The well-known worldwide leader company in this area, Universal Robots (UR) was incubated by the robotics institute, The Maersk Mc-Kinney Moller Institute, at SDU. Odense, the city where the university is located, is the center of the robotics industry in Denmark and has a national robotics cluster, Odense Robotics which consists of more than 250 robotics companies, SDU, and the Danish Technological Institute (a national research institute). In recent years, the government has invested 140 million DKK to build a brand-new SDU Industry 4.0 Lab ([https://www.sdu.dk/en/forskning/i40lab](https://www.sdu.dk/en/forskning/i40lab)), where this PhD project will be carried out.

The Robotics and Mechatronics (RaM) group, part of the Robotics Centre of the University of Twente (UT), is composed of approximately 60 people including faculty, technicians, and graduate students, and is involved in a large number of national and European projects. The group is responsible for pioneering research in the area of energy-aware robotics, modeling of physical systems, and energy-aware and passivity-based control, including for teleoperation systems. RaM provides an environment and culture directed to support synergy and creativity in an academic environment. RaM has 300 m² of labs with high-tech infrastructure including 4 KUKA arms, 4 Franka Emika arms, and a rapid prototyping lab with 21 3D printers, including a MetalX printer able to print titanium and steel, foam cutters, and laser cutters.
