# Faculty Position in Industrial Engineering
## School of Mechanical, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Oregon State University

The Oregon State University (OSU) Industrial Engineering (IE) Program in the School of Mechanical, Industrial, and Manufacturing Engineering invites applicants for a full-time tenure-track assistant professor position. We seek scholars with expertise in large-scale optimization and machine learning methods. Areas of application interest include, but are not limited to:
- Autonomous systems
- Healthcare systems
- Logistics systems
- Power systems
- Transportation systems

Ideal candidates will have some demonstrated experience in using machine learning methods to advance optimization models in specific domains.

Oregon State offers BS, MS, MEng, and PhD degrees in IE. The program has approximately 100 undergraduate students and 60 graduate students. The College of Engineering has over 170 faculty, and the IE program includes five permanent members along with instructional faculty. Program research is focused on the future of work with humans and intelligent systems collaborating in large scale systems. Our faculty develop new theories in systems engineering, process improvement, engineering management, information systems, manufacturing systems and logistics. Faculty and students also conduct empirical research to test and apply theory to industrial or societal-scale systems and data sets. Our culture is one of collaborative research, cooperation, and individuals taking initiative to better the program. The position has the opportunity for courtesy appointments with the AI Program and/or the Robotics Program. The successful applicant’s research will be empowered by one of the nation’s most powerful AI supercomputers in the Jen-Hsun Huang and Lori Mills Huang Collaborative Innovation Complex.

Candidates should hold a Ph.D. in industrial engineering, applied mathematics, computer science, computational science and engineering, or other relevant discipline in the engineering or mathematical sciences by the start date of employment. Candidates should also have a demonstrated record of scholarship. Qualified candidates with relevant industrial or national laboratory experience are also strongly encouraged to apply. Appointment is anticipated at the Assistant Professor rank. Applicants should demonstrate a strong commitment and capacity to initiate new extramurally funded research, and also to expand, complement, and collaborate with existing research programs in OSU’s College of Engineering, and beyond. Applicants must also demonstrate a strong commitment to graduate and undergraduate teaching, including developing new courses related to their research expertise, as well as PhD student supervision. Interest in, or experience with technology transfer and patents is considered a strength.
