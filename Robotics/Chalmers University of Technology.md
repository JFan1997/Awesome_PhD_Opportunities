# PhD Position in Humanoid Robotics at Chalmers University of Technology

Do you want to be a part of the ongoing revolution in the field of humanoid robotics and their successful deployment in industry? The aim of this PhD position is to develop algorithms for bi-manual manipulation as well as loco-manipulation tasks using mobile robots with a humanoid form factor. The research of the PhD student will touch upon various topics including multi-body dynamics, optimal control theory, machine learning, and robotics & artificial intelligence in general. The focus is broadly upon the development of numerically stable and efficient computational algorithms, their implementation, and testing with computer programs, both in simulation as well as real robotic systems. The PhD position is funded by the Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP) and the PhD student is expected to take part in activities organized in the context of the WASP graduate school.

## Information About the Department, the Division, and WASP

The Department of Mechanics and Maritime Sciences (M2) consists of seven research divisions within the areas of mechanical engineering and maritime sciences: Dynamics, Fluid Dynamics, Vehicle Safety, Vehicle Engineering & Autonomous Systems, Combustion and Propulsion Systems, Marine Technology, and Maritime Studies. The seven divisions conduct fundamental and applied research in close collaboration with national and international universities, research centers, and industries.

The Division of Dynamics, where the PhD student will be situated, has its research activities organized through four major research groups: Mechanical Systems, Structural Dynamics, Wave Propagation, and Railway Mechanics. You will be joining an emerging research lab led by Dr. Shivesh Kumar and will have the opportunity to contribute to a new focus on legged robotics and athletic intelligence research within the division. The teaching activities of the Division of Dynamics are very broad, from several courses at the bachelor level on mechanics and solid mechanics to master's level courses such as finite element methods, rigid body dynamics, structural dynamics, and structural dynamics control. The aim of the Division is to be world-class in both teaching and research with a mixture of theoretical and applied activities.

Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP) is Sweden's largest individual research program ever, a major national initiative for strategically motivated basic research, education, and faculty recruitment. The program addresses research on artificial intelligence and autonomous systems acting in collaboration with humans, adapting to their environment through sensors, information, and knowledge, and forming intelligent systems-of-systems. The vision of WASP is excellent research and competence in artificial intelligence, autonomous systems, and software for the benefit of Swedish society and industry.

The graduate school within WASP is dedicated to providing the skills needed to analyze, develop, and contribute to the interdisciplinary area of artificial intelligence, autonomous systems, and software. Through an ambitious program with research visits, partner universities, and visiting lecturers, the graduate school actively supports forming a strong multi-disciplinary and international professional network between PhD students, researchers, and industry.
