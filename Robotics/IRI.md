# PhD Student - Human-Robot Interaction (SOCIAL PIA project)
**Application Deadline: July 10th, 2024**
==============================

The Institut de Robòtica i Informàtica Industrial (IRI), CSIC-UPC is seeking a predoctoral researcher to work under the framework of a Moonshot Research & Development Program, financed by the Japan Science and Technology Agency. The candidate will be supervised by Prof. Alberto Sanfeliu and Dr. Anaís Garrell, and she/he will work in cooperation with the members of the Mobile Robotics and Intelligence System group at IRI.

## ABOUT IRI
IRI is a Joint University Research Institute in Barcelona, Spain, participated by the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) and the Technical University of Catalonia (UPC), that conducts research in human-centered robotics and automatic control. The institute is a key player in the Spanish robotics and automatic control scenes, and a valued participant in a large number of international collaborations.

## ABOUT SOCIAL-PIA Project
The SOCIAL-PIA (Cooperative Social PIA, Perception-Intention-Action, model for Cybernetics Avatars) project is under the Moonshot Goal 1 “Realization of a society in which human beings can be free from limitations of body, brain, space, and time by 2050” (Prof. Norihiro Hagita) and in the Moonshot project “The Realization of an avatar-Symbiotic Society where Everyone can Perform Active Roles without Constraint” (Prof. Hiroshi Ishiguro). The project started in April 2023.

The aim of the SOCIAL-PIA project is to develop cooperation between humans (with the operator and the end-user or bystander) and Cybernetic Avatars (CA) through the PIA paradigm (Perception-Intention-Action). The project proposes to conduct research on human intention and how it relates to the Situation Awareness and Decision-Making PIA processes, with two goals in mind: to assist the operator in handling Interactive/Cooperative tasks, and to improve the autonomous CA interaction/cooperation between CAs and end-users/bystanders. The PIA paradigm will allow anticipation of human action, be proactive or follow a preestablished plan. The project will be demonstrated in interactive and cooperative telepresence tasks.

## ABOUT THE PREDOC POSITION
The PhD student will work on AI and Robotics (perception, decision-making, robot navigation, or planning behaviors) techniques for human-robot cooperation. She/he will validate the new techniques in experiments with humanoid robots. The candidate is expected to publish the results of his/her research in top-tier conferences and journals of Robotics and/or Artificial Intelligence.

## APPLICATIONS
The candidate is expected to have an MSc or equivalent in Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science, or Engineering and good programming skills. Female candidates are strongly encouraged to apply.
