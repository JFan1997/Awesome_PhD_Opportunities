# PhD Position at the Robotics Institute Germany

The Learning & Intelligent Systems Lab @ TU Berlin is part of the newly created [Robotics Institute Germany (RIG)](https://www.robotics-institute-germany.de/). In the course of this cooperation, we are seeking a new PhD student with an excellent background in AI & robotics research, and a strong interest in learning systems, optimization, robotic manipulation, and planning. RIG is a highly collaborative network of Germany's leading robotics researchers. As a PhD student within this network, you will also participate in collaborative efforts, such as international robotics competitions (e.g., RoboCup Logistics League), robotics methodology and benchmark infrastructure, or network-wide teaching concepts and PhD symposia.

## Application Instructions
If interested in this position, please contact me informally by August 12 via plain email only:
1. Use the subject 'interest in RIG PhD position'.
2. Include links to any previous written work of yours (MSc thesis, other research/technical work).
3. Link to your CV.
4. Say a few words about your interests and background.

## Requirements
- Successfully completed university studies (Master, Diplom, or equivalent) in computer science or a similar technical subject.
- In-depth knowledge in robotics, optimization, and learning, including robotic manipulation.
- Excellent programming skills.

A more formal application procedure will follow, but with a very tight time frame later in August. (Please note that I will be on vacation until August 9 and cannot respond before the week of August 12).

Best,
