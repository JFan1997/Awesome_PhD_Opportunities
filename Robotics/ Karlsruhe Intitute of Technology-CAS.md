# PhD Position in Autonomous Driving and Robotics at KIT

## Overview
The Cooperative Autonomous Systems (CAS) group, headed by Prof. Alexey Vinel, at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) invites applications for a funded position in the field of autonomous driving and robotics.

## Job Description

### Topic
Automated vehicles promise to bring enhanced safety and more comfort to our roads. On the way towards full autonomy, sharing roads between autonomous vehicles (AVs) and human actors is unavoidable. Moreover, even if all vehicles on the road were automated, vulnerable road users (VRU), e.g., pedestrians, would still be crossing the streets. Vehicle-to-everything communication (V2X) enables vehicles to share their status, perception, and intention. However, how humans will be able to be part of the V2X paradigm is less clear. 

To address this challenge, the proposed thesis will investigate how a social robot can be used to orchestrate traffic and moderate interactions between VRUs (via natural communications) and automated vehicles (via digital communications). Relevant questions include how the robot can access and leverage information provided by collective perception systems formed by V2X-enabled AVs and how the multi-modal interaction with AVs and VRUs should look.

The thesis is conducted within a project funded by KIT Future Fields involving three research groups at KIT (with one PhD student per group).

### Your Role
- Conduct research in the predefined areas.
- Disseminate results via scientific publications.
- Implement proof-of-concept software tools.
- Collaborate with other researchers participating in the Future Fields project.
- Participate in teaching.

### Your Profile
The candidate should possess an MSc degree or equivalent in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, or any related discipline. The ideal candidate should have knowledge and experience in one or more of the following topics:
- Vehicle-to-everything communication
- Human-Robot Interaction
- Computer Vision
- Sensor Fusion
- Robotics
- Machine Learning
- Automated Driving Systems

The position requires strong analytical and programming skills. Fluency in English (verbal and written) is required; knowledge of German is a plus. Peer-reviewed scientific publications are a plus but not expected. Most importantly, you should be curiosity-driven and excited about science.

### What We Offer
PhD students will receive an internationally competitive salary and benefits according to the TV-L E13 scale. An initial contract will be offered for 1 year with the possibility of extension up to 5 years. We offer state-of-the-art research facilities, career and family support, access to many research partners, while being located in one of Germany's most beautiful and innovative regions.

### How to Apply
Applications should be sent via email to alexey.vinel@kit.edu with a single PDF document containing:
- Full CV (including name and contact information of 2-3 references)
- Transcript of modules and results from university courses
- Motivation letter or research statement
- Copies of any peer-reviewed publications (if any)

Applications will be accepted until the position is filled, but those received by 31 July 2024 will be prioritized. Early applications are encouraged.

KIT attaches great importance to professional equality between women and men. We are therefore particularly pleased to receive applications from women. Applicants with severe disabilities will be given priority if they are suitable.

## About the CAS and KIT
The research group "Cooperative Autonomous Systems" performs applied research on the aspects of coordination, cooperation, and communication between autonomous or highly automated vehicles, vulnerable road users, transportation infrastructure, and robots in complex environments. This includes the design and evaluation of vehicular communication (V2X) protocols, testing and validation of cooperative automated driving functions, and the development of new concepts for road transport coordination in cooperative intelligent transport systems (C-ITS).

The Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) was founded in 2009 through the merger of the University of Karlsruhe and the Karlsruhe Research Center. As a renowned German university of excellence and a technical university of the state of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, as well as a national research center in the Helmholtz Association, KIT is characterized by scientific excellence. With almost 10,000 employees, including over 400 professors, KIT is one of the largest and most respected technical universities in Germany. It focuses on first-class research activities on important future topics.
