## Project Overview
We invite applicants for a fully funded PhD position to contribute to cutting-edge research in data validation, analysis, and mapping for data collected in extreme environments. The main aim of this project is to develop state-of-the-art data analysis and mapping methods that are efficient, reliable, and near real-time. The successful candidate will play a key role in advancing methodologies for collecting, validating, and analyzing environmental data from challenging and hard-to-access environments (e.g., subglacial channels, underwater ecosystems, and abandoned mines). This project will concentrate on environmental data collected using various sensors and robot platforms designed and developed at the Centre for Biorobotics at Tallinn University of Technology.
