Dear Colleagues,

We are looking for a motivated PhD student to join the Dynamic Systems and Intelligent Machines (DSIM) lab at San Diego State University in Fall 2025.

This project aims to develop model-free adaptive control theoretical frameworks for long-range localization of signal sources in uncertain dynamic environments where measured signals are distorted, diverted, or diffused by environmental factors. The control strategies will safely steer unmanned vehicles to the location of static or moving signal sources, without knowledge of their position or the position of the sources.

The PhD degree is offered jointly with the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). For more information about the position and requirements, please visit:

The application deadline is December 15, 2024.

Best regards,
