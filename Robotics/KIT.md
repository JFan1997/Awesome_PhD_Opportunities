Dear Robotics Community,

Become part of the new and highly motivated, international **Machine Learning and Robotics research group** at the **Faculty of Mechanical Engineering at KIT**.

The mission of the **Machine Intelligence and Robotics Lab** is to create a new generation of autonomous and intelligent machines by combining **a priori model knowledge, open-source architectures and software, real machine data** with the latest machine learning methods and high-performance robotic hardware components.

### Job description

Making fast and accurate decisions while processing large amounts of data from various sensors in real time with local computing resources is a critical requirement for mobile robots. The aim of this **PhD position** is to design an **energy-efficient solution for edge AI** by using **neuromorphic architectures** that minimize the energy footprint by exploiting brain-inspired **spike-based computing paradigms**. The challenge is to combine **multimodal event-based sensor sources** for use in an unstructured, dynamic environment with our **legged walking robot ANYmal D**. This requires new complex algorithms to effectively extract and fuse relevant information. Your research in the new Machine Intelligence and Robotics Lab will contribute to improving the **adaptability, autonomy,** and **machine intelligence** of future mobile robots.

### What you can expect from us:

- A stimulating environment to innovate and develop cutting-edge machine learning approaches for dynamic **force-based assembly, grasping,** and **positioning** tasks.
- The opportunity to enhance your expertise in creating **robust and energy-efficient multimodal sensing systems** using **spiking neural networks (SNN)** for event-based sensor data (**Active Efficient Coding**).
- A chance to design and implement an **adaptive bio-inspired neuromorphic perception architecture** and integrate it on a mobile legged robot.
- Extensive opportunities to collaborate and communicate within an **international project focused on event-based neurorobotics**.
- Hands-on experience in developing software architectures and components, particularly with **ROS/ROS2**, and testing them on the advanced legged robot **ANYmal D**.
- Involvement in teaching and contributing to the fields of **neurorobotics, AI,** and **perception**.
- Continuous support for your personal and professional growth, including **training** and **career development** opportunities.
- The opportunity to work within an enthusiastic, highly motivated, international, and diverse team.
- The possibility to pursue a **PhD** within a new scientific robotics lab at KIT, contributing to groundbreaking research in robotics.

### Starting date
