We are hiring a talented and motivated PhD student in Vision-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to join our team at the Automation and Robotics Research Group of the SnT of the University of Luxembourg.

We offer a (3+1)-year fully funded position to work under the umbrella of a partnership project with the Luxembourg-based company [GAMMA AR](https://gamma-ar.com/).

All the information about the position and application here: [PhD Position Details](https://recruitment.uni.lu/en/details.html?nPostingId=96456&nPostingTargetId=140639&id=QMUFK026203F3VBQB7V7VV4S8&LG=UK&languageSelect=UK&sType=Social%20Recruiting&mask=karriereseiten)

Please, apply as soon as possible!

### In a nutshell:

The position holder will develop a solution for real-time vision-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) of a hand-held tablet on real construction sites (i.e. as-built), with drift-free alignment with existing building plans (i.e. as-planned). This solution will extend our Lidar Informed Situational Graphs (S-Graphs) and our Visual S-Graphs. Concretely, the main scientific challenges are the:
1. Vision-based global localization of the hand-held device within building plans (i.e. global alignment between the real construction site and the building plans) when the main structural elements (e.g. walls) are built and there are no major deviations from the building plans.
2. Vision-based individual alignment between the main elements of the construction site and building plans, when there are no major deviations.
3. Vision-based global and individual alignment between the construction site and its main elements and building plans in the presence of deviations.

The solution will be validated experimentally in real datasets and real construction sites (together with their building plans). On top of this, the solution will be integrated into our ready-to-use robotic platforms to demonstrate its potential use in autonomous robot systems in real-world use cases.

Starting date is flexible, aiming for S2/2024.
