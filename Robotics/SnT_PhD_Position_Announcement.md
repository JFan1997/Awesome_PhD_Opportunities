# SnT PhD Position Announcement

**SnT** is a leading international research and innovation centre in secure, reliable, and trustworthy ICT systems and services. We play an instrumental role in Luxembourg by fueling innovation through research partnerships with industry, boosting R&D investments leading to economic growth, and attracting highly qualified talent.

We’re looking for people driven by excellence, excited about innovation, and looking to make a difference. If this sounds like you, you’ve come to the right place!

## Position Overview

This industrial PhD position is part of the “Autonomous systems for Land, Air and Space” (ATLAS) IPGB Programme co-funded by the FNR, SnT, and a consortium of industrial partners and administrations, including eBus Competence Center, emile weber, GomSpace, Gradel, IEE, Nexxtlab, Telindus, and Ville de Luxembourg. For more information on the ATLAS IPBG Programme, see [here](https://edu.lu/wwpy7).

### Your Role

The successful candidate will join the UBIX Research Group, led by Prof. Raphaël Frank, in collaboration with the CVI2 Research Group, led by Prof. Djamila Aouada. Additionally, this industrial project will be conducted in partnership with the companies emile weber and the eBus Competence Center as part of the IPBG ATLAS Programme.

This PhD project aims to develop and validate an infrastructure-aided automated driving system for electric buses at the main depot of emile weber in Luxembourg. The project will deploy sensors and communication devices at the depot to automate e-bus navigation, enhancing operational efficiency. Instead of retrofitting buses with expensive equipment, the system will utilize depot-installed technology, requiring only a communication module and a drive-by-wire system on the buses. The project's outcome will be a proof-of-concept demonstrating the feasibility of this approach, with potential applications for broader automated driving initiatives.
