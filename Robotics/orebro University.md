## Topics

### Robotic Lab Automation for Handling Powdered and Granular Materials

Robotic lab automation is a major research focus in robotics that is often wrongly thought of as exclusively consisting of grasping, manipulating, and transporting test tubes and beakers which are placed in fixtures and lab machines. An overlooked but equally important task in a lab environment is the handling of powdered and granular chemical substances, which are essential for analytic and production processes. Handling powdered and granular materials must deal with arbitrarily shaped volumes of material in contact with hidden surfaces that can have complex geometry. To plan and execute efficient scooping actions, we need to perceive and understand the shape and dynamics of the volume of material as well as the hidden surface below it. In particular, the research within this topic will focus on the following:
1. Perceiving and modeling powdered and granular material on a hidden surface for scooping from interaction data using, e.g., force-torque and vibratory sensing.
2. Planning and executing scooping actions for efficient material transfer using the models from (1) and generating scooping actions along the hidden surface.
3. Planning and executing scooping actions for precise material dosing using online sensor feedback.

### Radar Radiance Maps for Robust Perception and Navigation

This topic is aligned towards truly robust, long-term, all-weather operation for self-driving vehicles and robots. More concretely, the research will be centered around modern 3D data representations such as neural radiance fields and Gaussian splatting, the use of state-of-the-art high-resolution radar sensors -- and the combination thereof. Common sensors like lidars and cameras struggle in low-visibility conditions (dust, smoke, fog). Despite recent progress toward long-term autonomy, ensuring reliable perception in all environment conditions remains a challenge. Radar presents several advantages for robust perception: long range, instantaneous per-point speed data, and insensitivity to attenuation. However, radar comes with its own set of challenges, including noise, multipath reflections, and artifacts arising from the wide beam width. Addressing these challenges is crucial for harnessing the full potential of radar in autonomous navigation and perception. The PhD student working on this topic will benefit from our established research on robust autonomy with radar data as well as ongoing work on neural representations and dense realistic 3D maps.

## The PhD Programme and the Work Environment

The AASS Center at Örebro University is among Sweden's largest research environments in AI and Robotics with more than 70 employees. Örebro University is a modern, broad-based, and growing university. We endeavor to be an attractive place of work where members of staff feel a sense of pride and satisfaction. Currently, 1,600 employees and 17,000 students come to work and study at Örebro University.

Both of these positions will be fully funded by the Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Programme (WASP), which is Sweden’s largest individual research program ever, a major national initiative for strategically motivated basic research, education and faculty recruitment. The programme addresses research on artificial intelligence and autonomous systems acting in collaboration with humans, adapting to their environment through sensors, information and knowledge, and forming intelligent systems-of-systems. The vision of WASP is excellent research and competence in artificial intelligence autonomous systems and software for the benefit of Swedish society and industry.

The graduate school within WASP is dedicated to providing the skills needed to analyze, develop, and contribute to the interdisciplinary area of artificial intelligence, autonomous systems, and software. Through an ambitious program with research visits, partner universities, and visiting lecturers, the graduate school actively supports forming a strong multi-disciplinary and international professional network between PhD students, researchers, and industry.
