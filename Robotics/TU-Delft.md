Dear colleagues,

We have a PhD vacancy in "Autonomous Reasoning on Robots Operating in the Real, Open World" in our team at TU Delft.

The PhD will work on creating autonomous robots that operate in the real world with various other PhDs and engineers at the KAS Lab group and the OpenBots project. OpenBots aims to develop a common sense capability for robots, enabling them to understand their surroundings and plan proper actions to execute their inspection task, even when part of their surrounding world is unknown and dynamic.

The research in this position will be related to world modelling and knowledge representation, i.e., creating the robot's situational awareness, assuming that it is able to detect and observe individual objects and events through its camera and microphone.

**Application deadline: July 20**
