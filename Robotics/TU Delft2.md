Hi,

Are you, or one of your students, interested in joining our team at the Autonomous Multi-Robots Lab of TU Delft? We have a PhD vacancy in our group, together with Joris Sijs.

The candidate will work on "Autonomous Planning on Task Execution for Robots Operating in the Real, Open World" in a multidisciplinary team. The OpenBots team aims to develop a common sense capability for robots, making them able to understand their surroundings and plan proper actions to execute their inspection task, even when part of their surrounding world is unknown and dynamic, and in collaboration with other robots.
