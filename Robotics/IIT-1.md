# 2 Open PhD Positions at IIT's Dynamic Legged Systems Lab
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Dynamic Legged Systems Lab at the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT), an English language Institute, is looking for outstanding candidates for 2 open PhD positions who will be involved in ongoing *space robotics, learning, and loco-manipulation research* towards *versatile all-terrain legged robots*. We focus on the theoretical as well as the practical aspects of legged robots, with applications in the fields of space robotics, precision agriculture, inspection, and disaster response.

The DLS research line has state-of-the-art facilities and equipment. We develop the hardware of quadruped robots, as well as the algorithms and software to make them move autonomously over unstructured terrain. The labâ€™s flagship platforms are the hydraulic robots HyQ and HyQReal, as well as some commercial electric quadruped robots.

The PhD call is through the University of Genova with a strict deadline on 9/JULY/2024 noon (CEST).
