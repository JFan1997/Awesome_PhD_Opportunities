# Ph.D. Position at the University of Montpellier

## Overview
We are pleased to open a position for a 3-year Ph.D. program at the University of Montpellier. The thesis will be conducted in large part (up to full-time) at AIST-CNRS JRL, in Tsukuba, Japan. If needed, short stays are also possible at the CNRS-University of Montpellier LIRMM, Montpellier, France.

## Ph.D. Topic: Plug-and-Walk Framework for Humanoid Locomotion
Humanoid robots represent a promising area of robotics, with potential applications in fields such as large-scale manufacturing, healthcare, disaster response, and domestic assistance. These robots are designed to navigate complex, dynamic environments, making effective locomotion a critical aspect of their functionality. Traditional methods for developing locomotion strategies often rely on formal models that provide strong guarantees of stability and efficiency under ideal conditions. However, these models can fall short when faced with the unpredictability and variability of real-world environments.

To address these challenges, researchers have explored the integration of simulations and real-world data into the development process. Simulations offer a cost-effective way to generate vast amounts of data, facilitating the training and optimization of locomotion strategies. They serve as a bridge between the idealized conditions of formal models and the complexities of real-world scenarios, allowing for extensive testing and refinement before deployment. However, simulations also have their drawbacks: they can never fully capture the complexities and nuances of real-world environments, and there may be discrepancies between simulated results and actual performance.

Real-world data, on the other hand, grounds the locomotion strategies in actual dynamics, ensuring that the models can handle real-life uncertainties and variations. By incorporating feedback from real-world interactions, the system can continuously adapt and improve, leading to more robust and reliable performance. Despite its advantages, using real-world data also presents challenges, such as the high cost and time required for data collection, as well as the potential risk of damaging the physical robot during testing. Additionally, data-driven techniques often lack the strong theoretical guarantees provided by formal models. While they can enhance adaptability and performance, they may not always ensure stability and efficiency under all conditions.

This research aims to develop a comprehensive framework that leverages the strengths of formal models, simulations, and real-world data to create adaptive and efficient locomotion strategies for humanoid robots. The proposed framework will utilize formal models to establish a stable and efficient foundation, employ simulations to generate extensive training data and bridge the gap between theory and practice, and incorporate real-world data to refine and adapt the locomotion strategies to actual conditions. By integrating these three aspects, the framework aims to achieve high reliability and performance in dynamic environments. The research will focus on developing a hybrid learning approach that enables continuous adaptation and optimization, ensuring that the humanoid robots can navigate complex environments effectively and efficiently.

## Objectives and Methodology
