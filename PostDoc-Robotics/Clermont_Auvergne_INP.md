# Context:
Clermont Auvergne INP Clermont (France) invites applications for a postdoctoral position to contribute to the fields of perception and control, applied to collaborative assembly and disassembly tasks.  This position is framed within the REMAIN SUDEO European project. The goal of this project is to develop a multi-robot system combining innovative perception and control strategies of deformable objects to develop research and innovation capacities for remanufacturing deformable industrial products. Within this project, multi-modal sensor-based control of the robotic platform interacting with operators and the environment will be investigated.  Sensor-based control strategies with different sensing inputs (visual, tactile, and force) for manipulating deformable objects in an industrial and collaborative environment considering one or several robotic arms will be considered. The different manipulation tasks require to development of novel path planning and grasping techniques using approaches such as sensor-based control, deformable object manipulation, learning from demonstration, deep reinforcement learning, etc.  The successful candidate is expected to have experience in AI, robotics, control, manipulation, or closely related fields.     
                                                                                                                             
# Keywords: AI, Robotics, Visual servoing, Tactile servoing, Path planning, Intelligent Control.

# Research:
We are looking for one highly motivated researcher who will focus on three open problems:

(iii) good skills in programming and use of related libraries such as C++/Python, ROS, Keras, PyTorch, etc.
(iv) proficiency in written and spoken English language.

# Application:
Applicants must submit
1/ a one-page cover letter,
2/ Curriculum vitae with publications list and contacts of 2 references,
3/ availability (the earliest feasible starting date).

Applicants must be prepared to provide two reference letters upon request.
Once we receive your application and it fits well for the position, you will be contacted within two weeks.

Applications should be sent, *in a single PDF document*, with the email subject [Post-Doc application] to:

Clermont Auvergne INP brings together three engineering schools, two research laboratories, and a doctoral school in different areas of engineering sciences (Chemistry, Advanced mechanics, industrial engineering, robotics, computer science) in a multicultural environment. It is an internationally oriented research-teaching institute, driven by research and strongly connected to the world of enterprise. The researchers involved in this project are all members of Institut Pascal.
Institut Pascal (IP) is a joint Research Unit (UMR 6602) of Clermont Auvergne University and the CNRS. Clermont Auvergne- INP and the University Hospital of Clermont-Ferrand are also partners of the laboratory. Institut Pascal was born from the merging of six laboratories encompassing Engineering and Systems Sciences: Process Engineering, Mechanics, Robotics, Physics for Information Sciences, and Health. Institut Pascal brings together in a single structure over 370 people. Each of these disciplines is developed at the highest international level. This strong disciplinary base is the breeding ground for interdisciplinary projects, for which the Institut Pascal works from the development of knowledge to its integration into systems.  The research developed at IP is part of the Clermont-Ferrand I-SITE CAP 20-25 project in academic and industrial partnerships. These include activities around mobile robotics, labeled by the IMobS3 laboratory of excellence, and a joint FACTOLAB laboratory with the Michelin Manufacture, where the IP is developing solutions for man-machine cooperation, the robotic manipulation of deformable bodies and the development of robotic platforms for agile and reconfigurable production, using artificial intelligence (AI). The researchers involved in the project have very strong experience in collaborative projects at the national and international levels.
The laboratory facilities include a cutting-edge technology center of 3,200 m2 offering a large panel of equipment for high-speed machining, robotics, vibratory analysis, tests, measurements, characterization, design, and manufacturing. Several vision and robotic arm systems are available: 2 Kuka LWR 4+ arms, 1 Baxter robot, 2 Franka Panda arms, 3 Robotnik+UR10 mobile manipulators, a vision capture system, etc. Our vision and robotic equipment will be used for the implementation of different strategies developed during the project.
