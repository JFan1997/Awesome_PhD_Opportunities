The Robotic Decision Making Laboratory at Oregon State University in Corvallis, Oregon has openings for multiple postdoctoral scholars to work primarily with Prof. Geoff Hollinger while collaborating with Profs. Kagan Tumer, Julie A. Adams, Stefan Lee, Ross Hatton, Sandhya Saisubramanian, Matthew Johnston, and Joe Davidson.

The postdoc would have the opportunity to work on one or both of two collaborative projects involving Oregon State University, University of Washington, UW Applied Physics Lab, and University of Oregon: (1) Coordinated robotic manipulation in underwater environments. This project involves development of dexterous, semi-autonomous manipulation capabilities for multiple robotic manipulators in energetic ocean conditions. (2) Design, coordination, and control of biologically inspired multi-robot systems in underwater environments. This project seeks to develop chains of soft robots inspired by the salp organism to provide low-signature, scalable, and survivable underwater robots suited for operating on the seabed near natural and artificial features.

The successful candidate will have (or will be expected to earn prior to start date) a Ph.D. in Robotics, Computer Science, Engineering, or a related field and should have expertise in at least one of the following areas: manipulation, multi-robot coordination, motion planning, robot perception, control, human-robot interaction, hardware design, and learning for autonomous robots/vehicles. Candidates should demonstrate experience in one or more of the following: algorithm design, software/systems engineering, hardware design, and theoretical analysis applied to robotic systems operating in harsh, unstructured environments. Candidates with expertise in autonomous underwater systems are of particular interest. Expertise in hardware and material design for soft actuators and sensors is also of interest.

Successful candidates will be hired as postdoctoral scholars and governed by the appropriate terms and conditions (https://gradschool.oregonstate.edu/postdocs/appointment-and-recruitment).

The initial appointments will be for one year and are renewable yearly by mutual agreement.

The postdoctoral scholar will take a leadership role in coordinating collaborations across the Collaborative Robotics and Intelligent Systems (CoRIS) Institute at Oregon State University (http://robotics.oregonstate.edu/) and with external collaborators in academia, government, and industry. The CoRIS institute at OSU is growing rapidly, now with more than 50 affiliated faculty, and we are looking for motivated, talented individuals to join our team.

To apply, email a single file containing your CV (please include citizenship and residency information) and a one page summary of research interests to:

geoff.hollinger@oregonstate.edu

with a subject line:
POSTDOC APPLICATION: LastName, FirstName

Positions are available with a possible option of starting as early as September 2024 or at a later negotiated date. Application review will begin on July 22, 2024, and applications will be reviewed afterwards as they are received.

俄勒冈州科瓦利斯市俄勒冈州立大学机器人决策实验室现有多个博士后学者职位，主要与Geoff Hollinger教授合作，同时与Kagan Tumer教授、Julie A. Adams教授、Stefan Lee教授、Ross Hatton教授、Sandhya Saisubramanian教授、Matthew Johnston教授和Joe Davidson教授合作。

博士后将有机会参与涉及俄勒冈州立大学、华盛顿大学、华盛顿大学应用物理实验室和俄勒冈大学的两个合作项目中的一个或两个：(1) 水下环境中的协调机器人操作。该项目涉及开发在充满活力的海洋条件下多个机器人操作器的灵巧、半自主操作能力。(2) 设计、协调和控制水下环境中仿生多机器人系统。该项目旨在开发受磷虾生物启发的软体机器人链条，以提供适合在自然和人工特征附近的海床上操作的低特征、可扩展和可生存的水下机器人。

成功的候选人将拥有（或预计在开始日期之前获得）机器人学、计算机科学、工程或相关领域的博士学位，并且应在以下至少一个领域具有专长：操作、多机器人协调、运动规划、机器人感知、控制、人机交互、硬件设计以及自主机器人/车辆的学习。候选人应在以下一个或多个方面表现出经验：算法设计、软件/系统工程、硬件设计以及应用于在恶劣、无结构环境中运行的机器人系统的理论分析。具有自主水下系统专长的候选人尤为感兴趣。具备软体执行器和传感器的硬件和材料设计专长的候选人也很有兴趣。

成功的候选人将被聘为博士后学者，并受适当条款和条件的约束（https://gradschool.oregonstate.edu/postdocs/appointment-and-recruitment）。

初始任命为一年，并可每年根据双方协议续签。

博士后学者将在协调俄勒冈州立大学协作机器人与智能系统（CoRIS）研究所（http://robotics.oregonstate.edu/）及与学术界、政府和工业界的外部合作者之间的合作方面发挥领导作用。俄勒冈州立大学的CoRIS研究所正在快速增长，现有超过50名附属教职人员，我们正在寻找积极、有才华的个人加入我们的团队。

申请请发送包含您的简历（请包括国籍和居住信息）和一页研究兴趣总结的单个文件至：

geoff.hollinger@oregonstate.edu

邮件主题：
POSTDOC APPLICATION: LastName, FirstName

职位可选择在2024年9月或商定的稍后日期开始。申请审查将于2024年7月22日开始，之后将继续审查收到的申请。
