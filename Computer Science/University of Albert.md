I am currently seeking talented students interested in performing their PhD in robotics at the Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The expected start date is as soon as possible (i.e., depending on visa availability as early as Jan 2025). These PhD positions are fully funded.

The research topics focus on mobile robotics. Topics in aerial robotics include:

- Aerial manipulation and force control
- Load transport
- Visual servoing
- Vision-based navigation
- State estimation
- Visual odometry
- Visual-inertial odometry
- Multi-vehicle system coordination
- Novel actuation
- Aerodynamic modelling
- Nonlinear control and observer design for force and motion control

### Desired student profile:

- MSc student preferred. If only a BSc, must be willing to pursue direct entry into PhD
- Motivated and organized, with a strong background and/or interest in:
    - Modelling
    - Control
    - Robotics
    - Unmanned aerial systems
    - Mathematics
    - Control theory
    - Physics
    - Embedded systems
    - Field testing
- Hands-on skills in:
    - C/C++
    - ROS
    - Linux
    - LAN administration
- Good communication and project management skills (e.g., supervising MSc or undergraduate students)
- Conference and journal publications are desirable
- Academic excellence and strong analytical thinking
- Open to gaining knowledge in AI as required by the robotic application, though not obsessed with AI

Please note that the requirement for admission to the Dept. of ECE at the University of Alberta must be met: [ECE Admission Requirements](https://www.ualberta.ca/engineering/electrical-computer-engineering/graduate-studies/how-to-apply/index.html)
