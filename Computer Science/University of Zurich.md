Several openings at both PhD and Postdoctoral levels in Robotics, Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Control, Computer Vision, and Event Cameras are available at my lab, the Robotics and Perception Group, of the University of Zurich.

Info and how to apply: [https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/positions.html](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/positions.html)

**************************
**Deadline for Applications and Starting Date**
**************************
The closing deadline for applications is September 30, 2024, but the screening of the applications has already started and will continue until the positions are filled. Thus, we encourage you to apply as soon as possible if you want to be guaranteed a spot. Starting date: as soon as possible.

**************************
**Job Description**
**************************
We have several fully-funded positions for PhD students and PostDocs:
- Vision-based Robot Learning with Foundation Models
- Low-Energy Vision with Event Cameras
- Vision-Based Localization for Autonomous Inspection
- Robust Control in Confined Spaces

The detailed job description can be found at the link shared above.

**Our Lab Mission and Impact**
**************************
The mission of the Robotics and Perception Group is to research the fundamental challenges of robotics and computer vision that will benefit all of humanity, and we want people with diverse perspectives and backgrounds. Our team includes various nationalities and ages. We belong to two departments: the Dept. of Informatics of the University of Zurich (which is our primary affiliation) and the Dept. of Neuroinformatics of the University of Zurich and ETH Zurich. 

Our researchers have received numerous distinctions, such as:
- Four-time finalists and one-time winner of the Georges Giralt Robotics Best PhD Thesis Award
- European Control Best PhD Thesis Award
- IEEE Kiyo Tomiyasu Technical Field Award
- European Research Council (ERC) Consolidator Grant (2 million Euros)
- IEEE Robotics Early Career Award
- Several industry awards (Google, Qualcomm, Kuka, Intel)
- Numerous paper awards (T-RO, RAL, IROS, CVPR, etc.)

Our former researchers now occupy positions at top-tier companies, have become professors at top universities, or have founded successful spinoffs (e.g., "Fotokite," "Zurich-Eye" (now Meta Zurich), and SUIND). The research carried out in our lab has received extensive media coverage for our work on agile robotics and event cameras (The New York Times, The Guardian, Forbes, The Economist, Neue ZÃ¼rcher Zeitung, La Repubblica, RAI, ZDF, ARTE, Super Quark, Canal+, etc.). 

Last year, we demonstrated that an AI-powered quadcopter could outperform world-champion drone racing pilots, a result published in *Nature* and considered the first time that an AI beats human experts in the physical world in a sport designed by humans for humans (previous AI wins in chess, Dota, Starcraft, Gran Turismo, and Go were done in simulation or board games). For an up-to-date list of our current research projects, videos, and press coverage, please check out our media page and YouTube channel.

**************************
**Benefits**
**************************
- We do world-class research: our two recent papers were published in *Nature*.
- We were the first to demonstrate an AI beating the best human in a physical world (previous AI wins in chess, Dota, Starcraft, Gran Turismo, and Go were done in simulation or board games): [PDF](#), [YouTube](#).
- Our students and postdocs have won many international awards and paper awards (full list).
- Whatever you will do with us, you will do well: all our former students and postdocs have landed at great companies or universities (MIT, Berkeley, UPenn, TU Berlin, Meta, Google, Microsoft, Skydio, Verity).
- Our research has often been featured in the world news (New York Times, Forbes, The Economist, BBC, etc.). Full list on our Media page.
- The position is fully funded and is a regular job with social benefits (e.g., a pension plan).
- You will get a very competitive salary and access to world-class research facilities (motion capture, 3D printing, large flying arenas (indoors and outdoors), and electronic and machine workshops).
- Excellent work atmosphere with many social events, such as ski trips, hikes, lab dinners, and lab retreats (check out our photo gallery).
- Regular visits and talks by international researchers from renowned research labs or companies.
- Collaboration with other top researchers in both Switzerland and abroad.

**************************
**Your Skills**
**************************
- A Master or PhD degree in computer engineering, computer science, mechanical engineering, robotics, physics, aerodynamics, or related fields.
- A strong passion for computer vision, robotics, mathematics, programming, and abstract thinking.
- Excellent written and spoken English skills.
- Very strong C++ and Python skills.
- Strong experience with robotic systems and/or aerial robots.
- Background knowledge in any of the following: deep learning, reinforcement learning, control, path planning, aerodynamics, state estimation, computer vision, numerical optimization.
- *Additionally for Postdocs:*
  - Excellent track record (publications in high-impact-factor conferences and journals).
  - Proven theoretical and practical experience in solving complex robotics or computer vision problems and implementing them efficiently.

- Familiarity with tools such as ROS, PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Git is desirable.
