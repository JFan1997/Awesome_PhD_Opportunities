I am currently a tenure-track assistant professor jointly affiliated with the Institute for Artificial Intelligence and the School of Integrated Circuits at Peking University. Before joining Peking University, I was a staff research scientist and tech lead in the Meta On-Device AI team, focusing on researching and productizing efficient AI algorithms and hardware for next-generation AR/VR devices. I received my Ph.D. degree in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin under the supervision of Prof. David Z. Pan, and my bachelor’s degree from Peking University under the supervision of Prof. Ru Huang and Prof. Runsheng Wang.

My research interests focus on efficient and secure multi-modality AI acceleration algorithms and hardware.

**研究方向**

我目前是北京大学人工智能研究所和集成电路学院的双聘助理教授。在加入北京大学之前，我是Meta公司设备端AI团队的研究科学家和技术负责人，致力于为下一代AR/VR设备研究和产品化高效的AI算法和硬件。我在德克萨斯大学奥斯汀分校电子与计算机工程系获得博士学位，导师是David Z. Pan教授；本科毕业于北京大学，导师是黄如教授和王润生教授。

我的研究兴趣集中在高效且安全的多模态AI加速算法和硬件上。
