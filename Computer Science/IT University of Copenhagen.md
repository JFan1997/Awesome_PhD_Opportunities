The Computer Science Department at IT University of Copenhagen (ITU) invites highly motivated individuals to apply for a fully funded industry-based PhD position in active inspections using a quadruped robot and aerial drones. The position will be supervised by Associate Professor Andrés Faíña, with Thomas Søby Eriksen and Thiago Ferreira Rabello as company supervisors from Novo Nordisk. The ideal starting month is 15 December 2024 or soon thereafter.

The IT University’s vision is to create and share knowledge that is profound and leads to groundbreaking information technology and services for the benefit of humanity. The Computer Science Department seeks to conduct research and education that are both foundational and impactful on industry and society.

### The Project
The project is a collaboration between Novo Nordisk, Helix Lab, and the IT University of Copenhagen. It aims to automate inspections at Novo Nordisk factories by using a quadruped robot with a manipulator and one or several aerial drones. The qualified candidate will explore coordination and learning strategies for performing the inspections.

### The Ideal Candidate:
- Has experience in controlling robots using the Robot Operating System (ROS).
- Has experience with quadruped robots and/or aerial drones.
- Has knowledge of positioning systems and localization algorithms.
- Has knowledge of Artificial Intelligence (e.g., reinforcement learning or evolutionary algorithms).
- Could develop simple mechanical and electronic prototypes (this skill is a plus but not necessary).
- Is motivated and enthusiastic about carrying out research related to robotics and artificial intelligence.
- Has a background in computer science or similar.
- Has excellent English communication skills.

### Research Environment
The qualified applicant will join the [Robotics, Evolution, and Art Lab (REAL)](https://real.itu.dk/) at ITU and be supervised by Associate Professor [Andrés Faíña](https://real.itu.dk/people/afaina/).

The Computer Science department at ITU is a strong, highly international institution ([https://en.itu.dk/research/departments/computer-science-department](https://en.itu.dk/research/departments/computer-science-department)).

The PhD student will also be part of the PhD School at ITU.

We aim at building a diverse team. All applications are welcome, and those from members of underrepresented groups are especially encouraged.

In Novo Nordisk, the PhD student will be anchored in the Remote Operations section, a team driving changes needed to meet Novo Nordisk’s future operations strategic ambitions. Novo Nordisk’s ambition is to support a more sustainable work life for their workforce and, if the project is successful, Novo Nordisk will be able to lower the risk of developing chronic diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and obesity among employees working night shifts. Thus, the project will focus on mapping and eliminating manual interventions or automating them to facilitate fully automated operations during night shifts.

Additionally, the project involves Helix Lab, a research and education center in Kalundborg funded by the Novo Nordisk Foundation, with state-of-the-art biotech and robotics laboratories. The PhD student is expected to contribute to the development of the research community at Helix Lab alongside peers—other PhD students, MSc students (Helix Lab Fellows), and specialists in Kalundborg. The PhD student is also expected to serve as a strong ambassador for Helix Lab and spend approximately 50% of the time in Kalundborg, divided between Novo Nordisk and Helix Lab.
